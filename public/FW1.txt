Miyashita Yuu - Endgame (doctormango)
Length	3:17
BPM 	250
OD		7
SR		6.36
==========================
1st custom
250BPM seems not that fast considering we have vend previously.
But this is big leap from vend in terms of tapping densities. Pretty much simulation to releases hell map and also long in term of song length.
Alongside with chordjack patterns, there are alot of burst dumps patterns as well
You can say this is not just test your coordination but it also lil bit technicality as well.
The structures felt really consistent from beginning to second 1/3 of map, until the last part felt lil bit denser compared with first 2 chorus parts
You only have like few breaks here, especially just on last 3rd quarter of the map. Otherwise just keep slurping there.

CO2
YOASOBI - Yoru ni Kakeru (gzdongsheng) 1.1x rate
Length	3:54
BPM 	286
OD		8
SR		6.39
==========================
Prepare to be DMCA'd
Compared with previous pick, this is not have much chordjack but it definitely faster. Longer song length and have higher OD makes it mostly will be harder compared with endgame
Chorus parts full of some stream bursts and it's also the densest part of the map, please take care of that.
Like previous pick, because of song structure, your break mostly only in 3rd quarter of map, although you can consider taking a lil bit break in more sparse sections, it probably not gonna enough time for you to recover the composure.

CO3
KURORAK - Gamma Stop Giving Me Hard Bags (chxu)
Length	4:37
BPM 	174-432 (222)
OD		7.7
SR		6.3
==========================
2nd custom
How to describe this map in short? Davvy's encryption in steroids..
Overall I'll say this is one coordination pick that lil bit tends to wildcard with our current pool structure
This is one pick that you can consider if you have some physical capabilities against your opponent. There are alot of intrusive patterns as you can see, especially elongated LN & minijacks.
First half is filled by 222 BPM, it gets faster when you goes into second half with 255 BPM
Also funny pattern in last part, hope you like it the custom noodles menu by chxu
With the map patterns structure like this, I don't expect someone will FC it in match since it's really chokable at some point, also it definitely one of harder side map in pool, so good luck.

TE1
Outsider - Acquaintance (FelixSpade)
Length	2:54
BPM 	130
OD		7
SR		6.22
==========================
3rd custom
1st LN Prodigy in final pool
2nd LN Prodigy in this tourney
Gonna put a note here that this is NOT skwid's convert, FelixSpade literally made pattern by himself
This map has alot of mixed rhythms & patterns between fast single streams bursts, JS, and jacks at 130 BPM. You may thinking that some patterns here are cheeseable to be rice but you can see some releases are a lil bit awkward to play, that's why control on this map still required.
So just make sure you really read those without messing up your acc too much
First and second chorus structure are kinda same but as you reach the last one, the structure differs alot and it felt mostly harder compared with first 2.

TE2
Mono. - Susceptible (DannyPX)
Length	3:06
BPM 	180
OD		8
SR		6.36
==========================
4th custom
This is significant upgrade from Dille previously
Not gonna say too much. There are alot of bursty patterns alongside with LN releases. OD8 on this complements the difficulty overall on this map. You'll feel that this is really difficult to avoid acc drop.
Yeah.. you may see alot of lachryma pattern in mid + last part but honestly it isn't a big deal compared with other main tech parts there.
Last part with burst + minijack definitely will make you miss if you're not capable to hit it as well.

==========================

Sta feat. Ice - Cathedral (Micleak)
Length	2:28
BPM 	201
OD		7.3
SR		6.52
==========================
5th custom
Crankin in steroids, thx Micleak
Personally this is one of hardest map in pool.
Overall main difficulties here are put in intro and chorus parts. There are alot intrusive patterns, bursts of polyrhythm combined with minijacks at 201 BPM already explain itself how difficult it is to even hit it. If you have no difficulty with those 2 main parts and somehow FC'ed those, then other parts should be really easy for you right? Probably no, there are still some intrusive + choke points even besides the main parts..

==========================

TE4
phonon - Polyriddim (Izadi House Flip) (TheFunk & Akatsumi)
Length	2:26
BPM 	110-125 (125)
OD		7.5
SR		6.18
==========================
6th custom
Too bad it isn't original one
I found this could be the most picked in matches since this is not as physical demanding compared with other TE picks.
Overall, the map felt also tests your coordination. There are alot of short LNs and tight gaps which may felt tricky to play. Especially looking at how sparse the overall map compared with something like cathedral.
This map felt really generous to give you alot of break sections.
Also last pattern is way too sus to look at

xi vs. Kaneko Chiharu - Op.I fear-TITAN- (MyZterioN-) 1.05x rate
Length	2:29
BPM 	223
OD		7.5
SR		6.59
==========================
7th custom
Not symphony chaos btw
This is one of wildcard picks that tends to density. But as you continue to play, you can see there are alot several burst, minijacks, grace notes. Which is why we put this as wildcard instead of density pick.
Op.I overall felt an significant upgrade from Inixia previously in term of density and also pattern variations here to test on.
As you reach the last part of the map, it just gettin denser, make sure you prepare with your physical capabilities on this since it will mostly tested in the end of map.

Laur - Nostalgic Blood of the Strife (Logan636 & FelixSpade)
Length	1:54
BPM 	240
OD		7.6
SR		6.61
==========================
8th custom
One of shortest pick but another harder side pick we offer in this pool, prepare your mental and physical for this.
Beginning part filled by casual LN releases part. But as you enter the actual song, it gets really-really dense. Mix of chordjack and broken JS + splittrills at 240BPM prepares to punch your acc out. You only have 1 break at mid part, but that's all, because on next part, there is no stopping point, you have to continue until the song ends.

==========================

WC3
uma vs Morimori Atsushi - Re : End of a Dream (Raveille & FelixSpade)
Length	2:19
BPM 	212
OD		8
SR		6.2
==========================
9th custom
In term of structure it consists mostly of density JS patterns at 212 BPM along side with few intrusive minijacks.
You can say this mostly as an alternate rave's larva form MWC 2018 finals.
Even if this mostly filled with straightforwards patterns in term of rice but it's really tricky in term of LN looking at how inconsistent the releases here to be called as density / your casual full LN maps
It has alot of intrusive patterns in middle of more-straightforward patterns here which had been prepared to kill your acc.

==========================

Camellia - Sulfide (Micleak)
Length	2:42
BPM 	170
OD		7.7
SR		6.48
==========================
10th custom
After a journey from densities wildcard, it's time for tech-oriented wildcard
The map doesn't really show its difficulty before you reach 60-second of the map. When you saw the grace notes there, you know you're facing the true difficulty here.
I can see several players can treat the pattern in mid part just like full LN kinda. But one thing to note is several releases here are not in same gaps as the other parts which makes it really tricky to play if you don't realize it.
As you leaving the chorus section, it just doesn't end yet, there are several tech patterns you have to hit again until the very last part of the map.

Hatsuki Yura - confession (Akatsumi & eZmmR) 1.15x rate
Length	3:13
BPM 	145
OD		7.5
SR		5.92
==========================
11tzh custom
If you try to combine clockwork rose and black princess, I think it could be like this.
This is one wildcard that tends to coordination but in same time it tests your jack-coordination capabilities also in fast BPMs.
In chorus section you'll find alot of 4-jack pattern which is really intrusive and also some bursts + polyrhythms. Oh yeah, the map literally doesn't stop until half and last quarter of the map, that's your only 2 breaks. Even so, last part have harder pattern structure compare with first 2 chorus patterns, look at those jumpjack stair patterns there.. and also prepare the jacks before the outro.
So if you love jacks and LN at same time, this is definitely a pick for you

DE1
Helblinde - Grief & Malice (FelixSpade) 1.15x rate (cut)
Length	2:39
BPM 	230
OD		7
SR		6.33
==========================
12th custom
2nd LN Prodigy in this pool
3rd LN Prodigy in this tourney
I hope you're ready with some fast BPMs from now on in density picks here.
First half mostly filled with casual JS at 230 BPM, but as you reach the mid part where things getting really dense, single streams there really could put you in a predicament.
As you reach the chorus part, take note it has mixes between 1/4th JS and 1/6th bursts. Shortly after that you'll faced with chordjack LNs at 115BPM, and reaching last part, there are mix patterns between 1/4th JS, 1/6 bursts, some LN Jack anchors as well.

DRIVE. - SO GRAND. (DannyPX)
Length	2:29
BPM 	233
OD		8
SR		6.05
==========================
13th custom
One of lowest SR in this pool but you know Danny's map, you know it'll be underrated as fuck.
It filled with mix of short JS LN streams and longer one at same time in 233BPM. This is probably one pick that requires control alot compared with other densities pick, looking at how releases and OD also to not dropping 200 so much.
It has alot of sparse part in beginning but you'll feel it's really dense when you entering the main part here and also last part.
Oh yeah, last part filled with handstreams instead of jumpstreams, so beware of that.

==========================

DE3
beatMARIO (COOL&CREATE) - Invisible Full Moon (Cut Ver.) (TheFunk) 1.1x rate
Length	2:07
BPM 	220
OD		8
SR		6.55
==========================
14th custom
One of short side map in pool.
Definitely an upgrade from tortura last time, and also this is more spread nicely compared with tortura which is backloaded.
This is your casual 220 BPM JS density alongside with few 110BPM jack patterns as well. One thing to note is there are LN anchors as well especially in non-chorus parts.
While the chorus test your densities / physical, several releases in verse parts definitely one that you can't underestimate on.

xi - Event Hor!zon (FelixSpade) 1.1x rate
Length	3:41

SR		6.39
==========================
15th custom
3rd LN Prodigy in this pool
4th LN Prodigy in this tourney
Phoenix 1.1 is too easy huh? Here's the one density stamina-draining pick that should balance the pool.
I don't think there are alot to say with this one, if you play alot of FelixSpade's LN prodigy JS-type maps before, then you already knew the gist of it.
You don't really have much break in this map compared with phoenix previously, this one only has like 1 break even if you consider it so, and that's when you enter 2:30 length of the map.
I consider the last part to be the hardest part as it filled by HS, stairburst, dense JS. But if you are really capable of handling 220BPM LNs + HS, you should have no trouble with it.

==========================
16th custom
There are alot of stuffs happening here..
This is pretty much the gist of what you'll see in grand final pool I'd say.
