1) On windows
    - go the folder where ever your cli's are located (typicall in android_root directory) - to sem dal do path
    - Start the android emulator
        - emulator @name (emulator should be up and running) (keep this tab open)
    - in another tab run, - C:\platform-tools
        - adb kill-server
        - adb -a nodaemon server start (default to listening port 5037) (keep this tab open)
2) On linux (wsl2)
    - ensure that android studio is closed
    - ensure that 5037 is not busy (sudo lsof -i -P -n | grep LISTEN)
    - Run the proxy
        - socat -d -d TCP-LISTEN:5037,reuseaddr,fork TCP:$(cat /etc/resolv.conf | tail -n1 | cut -d " " -f 2):5037
    - check if adb are visible
        - adb devices (it should show running adbs/emulator)
    - Now you can start android studio
